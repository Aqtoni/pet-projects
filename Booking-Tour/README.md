# Booking-Tours Application üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüéã

Realistic nature-touring web app made for fun. Sign up or log in, book a tour update your profile, make payment with your credit card (don't be afraid to try it, you won't loose a peny üòâ) and do much more. üåéüö£‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I built this app with a great teacher <a href="https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann" target="_blank"> Jonas Schmedtmann </a> using modern technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose. And handling a lot of modern bugs, which appeared from different versions, but still, this was a great challenge for me. ü§íü§Ø 
There are many comments in the project, I made them for myself, but I decided to leave them for the public, as they will help newcomers and others to understand better. ü•∏
